## ðŸ“– Abstract
AEON-SOL is a continual learning framework that combines neuroscience-inspired adaptive consolidation with practical implementability.  
It addresses catastrophic forgetting through three core mechanisms:
1. Valence-gated dual-loop architecture  
2. Counterfactual credit assignment  
3. Memory-constrained learning  

Our experiments demonstrate an **87% reduction in catastrophic forgetting** with **94.2% average accuracy** on sequential classification tasks.
