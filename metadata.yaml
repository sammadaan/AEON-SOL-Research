abstract: |
  AEON-SOL is a continual learning framework that combines neuroscience-inspired 
  adaptive consolidation with practical implementability. It addresses catastrophic 
  forgetting through three core mechanisms: valence-gated dual-loop architecture, 
  counterfactual credit assignment, and memory-constrained learning. Experiments 
  demonstrate an 87% reduction in catastrophic forgetting with 94.2% average accuracy 
  on sequential classification tasks.
